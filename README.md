🌱 Crop Smart – Project Overview

📌 Project Title

Crop Smart – AI-Based Smart Crop Advisory System

Overview

Crop Smart is an intelligent farming assistance application designed to support farmers in making data-driven agricultural decisions. The system integrates **location-based analysis, soil and weather data, and AI-powered image processing** to recommend suitable crops and provide complete crop management guidance. The goal of Crop Smart is to improve crop yield, reduce farming risks, and enhance farmer satisfaction using modern technology.


Objective

* To help farmers select the **right crop** based on soil and climatic conditions
* To provide **real-time crop recommendations** using location and image data
* To reduce crop failure and increase productivity
* To offer **step-by-step crop cultivation guidance**

### ⚙️ How Crop Smart Works

1. **Location Detection**

   * Uses GPS or map selection to detect the farmer’s location
   * Fetches local **temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil type**

2. **Crop Recommendation**

   * Suggests suitable crops (e.g., Cotton, Rice, Soybean) based on environmental conditions

3. **Image-Based Crop & Soil Analysis**

   * Farmers upload a photo of soil or crop
   * AI analyzes the image to identify crop type, soil condition, and potential issues

4. **Crop Guidance System**

   * Provides detailed information on:

     * Sowing methods
     * Fertilizer usage
     * Irrigation schedule
     * Pest and disease prevention
     * Harvest timing

5. **Weather Alerts**

   * Alerts farmers about:

     * Heavy rainfall 🌧️
     * Heat waves 🔥
     * Frost ❄️
     * Strong winds / Cyclones 🌪️
